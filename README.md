# Natural Number Game (v 1.3.3) Solutions

Set of proofs I came up with while playing the [Natural Number Game](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/).
They probably won't drift off too far from the provided solutions ...

... but thought I'd save 'em as a reference so I can come back to them down the line and be like: "Ah, I'm so dumb, there's a more efficient way to do this!" or "Ah, this is pretty nifty, I'm gonna use this trick!"

As a side note, the game is super fun and I'm glad I spent my time on it.
Playing around with theorem provers has been on my list of to-dos for a while due to seeing others play around with Agda and Coq a bunch
So, FINALLY, I sat myself down and went through this.
Would definitely recommend the reader to spend a couple hours going through this.
